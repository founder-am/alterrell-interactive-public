## Pipeline legend

Steps: `brief` → `data-audit` → `tab-map` → `copy-draft` → `voice-pass` → `ama-rewrite` → `build` → `qa` → `deploy` → `live`

Session types: `T1` = editorial (claude.ai) · `T2` = build (Claude Code) · `T3` = platform (Claude Code)

Gates: `[AMA]` = decision or approval needed from AMA before next step

Status: `done` · `current` · `next` · `blocked` · `parked`

## ACTIVE — needs work

### Concert Tax (`/concert-tax/`)
- [x] Brief
- [x] Build
- [x] Hub card title: "The Male Laziness Epidemic" (T3, April 2026) — piece title decision still pending `[AMA]`
- [x] Piece `<h1>` updated: "The Male Laziness Epidemic" (was "The Hidden Concert Tax") (T3, April 2026)
- [x] D3 diagnostic (T2 session, April 2026) — root cause: img placeholders, no library loaded, no init code
- [x] D3 build (T2 session, April 2026):
  - `<body class="has-breadcrumb">` added
  - Nav markup fixed to `.ai-nav-brand` / `.ai-nav-meta` canonical classes
  - `.ai-nav-meta a` color override added for dark OF background
  - Static img tags replaced with `#ct-chart-bubble` and `#ct-chart-historical` divs
  - D3 v7 loaded from CDN at end of `<body>`
  - `initBubbleChart()` and `initHistoricalChart()` implemented with dimension guard + re-init flag
  - `showTab()` triggers charts via `requestAnimationFrame` when `idx === 1`
- [x] Data tables build (T2 session, April 2026):
  - Collapsible `<details class="ct-data-table">` added under each chart (collapsed by default)
  - Table 1 (bubble): 16 rows matching D3 bubble data array exactly
  - Table 2 (historical): 33 rows matching D3 historical artists array exactly
  - Female rows gold left border `#E8B923`, male rows teal `#0a7c72`
  - `'Mid'` → `'Standard'` production tier label replaced in JS tierLabels array and all HTML table cells
  - Note: tables use dark `#0a0a12` background per AMA instruction (deploy checklist deviation)
- [x] **Structural fix (T2, 2026-04-27):** Hero section + journey block extracted from Tab 1 to canonical position
  - `<header class="ct-hero-section">` (eyebrow + h1 + subhead) placed between breadcrumb and journey block
  - `.ct-journey-standalone` wrapper placed between hero and tab nav
  - Journey block reduced from 4 → 3 items: removed "Explore / All Pieces" link; kept Watch, Read, Ko-fi
  - YouTube URL updated to canonical playlist URL
  - Substack URL in journey block updated to section URL + UTM param
  - CSS added: `.ct-hero-section` (padding + OF background) and `.ct-journey-standalone` (wrapper + 3-col grid)
- [x] **OG meta fixed (T2, 2026-04-27):** `<title>`, `og:title`, `twitter:title` all updated to "The Male Laziness Epidemic — Obsidian Futures" (was "Gender & Genre: The Hidden Concert Tax")
- [ ] AMA visual review on live server — charts + data tables render correct? `current` `[AMA]`
- [ ] Deploy `blocked until AMA confirms charts + tables render`
- **Remaining deviations (for future sessions):**
  - Journey block items use `background: var(--of-card)` (#111118 dark) — deploy checklist requires white #ffffff for piece journey blocks. Deferred: design decision needed before fix.
  - Data tables use dark `#0a0a12` background — documented AMA override, intentional deviation.
  - Nav meta has 3 items (Substack · YouTube · $ Ko-fi) — standard is 2 items; Ko-fi in nav is non-standard.
  - Nav Substack URL is root `https://alterrell.substack.com` — should be section URL.
  - Part 2 tease Substack link is root URL — should be section URL.
  - Voice pass not yet done — all body copy is AI-drafted and awaiting AMA rewrite.
  - Tab structure (6 tabs) does not match CONCERT-TAX-BRIEF.md (5 tabs) — deferred.
- **Next session:** T3 platform · deploy after AMA confirms visual review · same commit as hub card fix if any
- **Blocking:** AMA visual review

## STANDING DECISIONS

- Hub ships before any new piece in same deploy
- Batch A (platform) always deploys alone and verified before Batch B or C
- Never mix batch types in one commit
- All copy must pass AI voice pass + AMA rewrite before deploy
- Substack URL: https://alterrell.substack.com/s/alterrell-interactive?utm_source=newsletter_page
- YouTube URL: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBmJd1HY9o6YvRW5PDW0jOGJley2AjNYS
- **"Get early access" copy is retired platform-wide (2026-04-27).** Replace with: "Get the story behind the story →" in all share blocks. AMA authorized combined Batch A + C deploy.
- **Substack nudge in share blocks must link to section URL** `/s/alterrell-interactive?utm_source=newsletter_page` — never root URL.
